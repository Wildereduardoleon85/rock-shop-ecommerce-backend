    description:
      'Guitars in the LTD Deluxe EC-1000 Series are designed to offer the tone, feel, looks, and quality that working professional musicians require in an instrument, while remaining affordable enough for serious players. With the EC-1000T CTM, the T stands for traditional, referring to this model’s full-thickness body that’s chambered for weight relief, with no waist-cut like the typical EC-1000 model. It also features multi-ply body/headstock binding on body top and back. This guitar offers a mahogany body with an outstanding flamed maple top, and set-thru construction at 24.75 scale, with a satin-finished mahogany neck. The sound of the EC-1000T CTM is powered by a set of Fishman Fluence Open Core Classic Humbucker pickups with push-pull controls to select between three different voicings, offering the tone and response of both active and passive pickup varieties voice 1 2 as well as single-coil varieties Voice 3. Other features include gold hardware, a TonePros locking bridge and tailpiece, and a Macassar ebony fingerboard with 22 extra-jumbo stainless steel frets.',

      'KMS 104 Handheld Vocal Condenser Microphone Black. The KMS 104 was developed to optimally transmit the human voice with respect to the demanding conditions present on the live stage. The KMS series has become the internationally acknowledged standard for first-class stage microphones. The high acoustic resolution and smooth frequency response of the microphones ensure that the musician has optimal control of the stage performance at all times. Especially due to their low self-noise and crosstalk behavior which is free of coloration, the KMS microphones are ideal for use with in-ear monitoring systems. The KMS 104 has a condenser microphone capsule with a cardioid directional characteristic which provides the best possible suppression of sounds originating from behind the microphone. In close cooperation with professional musicians, with the aid of extensive practical tests, the KMS 104 plus has been especially optimized for the requirements of female voices in the rock and pop field. The user can thus select the version that is optimally suited to the specific application. Acoustic features The studio condenser capsules used in the microphone versions provide the basis for transmitting all the nuances of the human voice. In comparison with other handheld microphones, which operate mostly with dynamic capsules, the KMS series has a particularly high acoustic transparency, a wide frequency range and a fine resolution of transients. In KMS microphones, carefully adjusted acoustic filters and transformerless impedance converters that can handle very high sound pressure levels prevent the microphones from being overloaded even by strong plosive sounds. In spite of excellent pop protection, sibilants and "S" sounds are transmitted with their natural accentuation, as is possible only with condenser microphones. Furthermore, the above-mentioned acoustic filters are designed so that the distinctive directional characteristics of the capsules are preserved even in the bass.',
